            Whether it's simply just playing Candy Crush or entering the high stakes world of e-sports, gaming has become
            a major part of recreation in modern day society. 
          <p>
            As technology advances, so do the platforms that games are released on. Just within a short twenty years, 
            the impossible has been made possible yet time and time again. At the start of the centry, the iconic Play Station 2 was the 
            talk of the world. Now we can find ourselves immersed in a virtual world through VR headsets and 3D animation.<br>
            <br>By looking at five gaming platforms from the eighth generation of gaming consoles, this project will attempt to analyse which
            generated the most sales of video games and which pltform has the best reviews for its games. 
            Machine learning will also be applied on userscore data to reach a more detailed answer. <br><br>
            So,
            <br>

            <h4>Play Station 4</h4>
            <p><em>Initially released in late 2013, this console was the successor to Sony Computer Entertainment Play Station 3. 
              Many iconic games such as The Last of Us and Fall Out 4 are available on this platform.Retailing at around the $350-$450 AUD mark,
              this powerful console is still widely used today. The set up consists of a console and a controller. </em></p>

            <h4>Play Station Vita </h4>
            <p><em>This handheld console was released in December 2011 by Sony Computer Entertainment. It's main rival during this time 
              was Nintendo's 3DS. Design was inspired by the well known GameBoy Advance consoles. Some well known games to be released on 
            this platform are Persona 4 Golden and Assassins Creed III: Liberation. </em></p>
          </div>
          <div class="resume-item">
            <h4>XBox One</h4>
            <p><em>This console and controller platform was the main compeition to the Play Station 4. Released late 2013 by Microsoft, it 
              aimed to deliver a more refined and streamlined gaming experience than its precursor, the XBox 360. Its main advantage over Play Station 
              was its multimedia and co-op applications. Notable games on this platform are Grand Theft Auto V and the Forza Series. 
              Production of this console was halted some time around 2020 as Microsoft worked on releasing newer XBox consoles. Today, a second hand XBox One
              retails at around the $200-$300 AUD mark.

              Nintendo console to support HD graphics. The design interface on the WiiU GamePad is similar to the Play Station Vita. 
              This platfrom is home to exclusive games such as The Legend of Zelda: Twighlight Princess HD, Splatoon and Mario Party 10. Production
              of the Wii U ended in Janurary 2017.

              This platform has been no stranger to the technological revolution

              PS4 or XBox One. The gamer is able to fully customise their PC to suit their gaming desires. This can include installing new hardware (such as a 
              improved graphics card) or upgrading their set up. Undertale and Minecraft are just two of the well known games available on this platform.

            <p>Began with the release of the WiiU in 2012.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Although it's debatable when exactly the Eighth Generation ended, it is reasonable to assume it ended between the years 2017 and 2020.
              This generation brought an advanced and refined gaming experience. As well as that, a lot of consoles released during this period not only fulfiled their 
              gaming purpose but also provided other services such as Netflix or social media applications.<br><br>
              The bubble chart gives a simple look at the total sales for of video games for each platform. As seen, Play Station 4 has the largest bubble, indicating that 
              video games released on this platform generated the most sales in total.<br><br>
            </p>

            This next line graph provides a glance at each year and how the platform performed in terms of video game sales. As seen, 2015 saw a great amount
            of sales for the Xbox One and Play Station 4 consoles. Abrupt line starts for these consoles indicate that they were released within the year the line begins.<br><br>
            Many lurking variables can attribute to the trends seen in both graphs. A major one is the way in each platform is marketed. PC's, for example, can be marketed in numerous
            ways such as as a study tool, office tool or gaming tool. As well as that, buying a video game is just that. It does not reflect user opinion of that game on the platform. A user
            can buy a game but then never play it or only play half of it. This is not very useful when attempting to determine if a relationship exists for this study. <br><br>
            Each graph is fully interactive. Tooltips are available upon hover to reveal how much exactly was amassed in sales.

            <p><em> esstentially multiple smaller Decision Trees collected together to work as an "ensemble." </em></p>
            <hr>
            <p>A Decision Tree can be visualised best as a dichotomous key in biology. Whilst they both service
            different purposes, the logic behind them is essentially the same. One choice leads to another,
            which leads to another, which leads to a final end result. By combining multiple Decision Trees together, a Forest is created. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In a Random Forest Classifier, multiple decision trees are called upon to create a reliable prediction as to the importance of one 
              factor on another. This predictive model works best if the trees in the forest or no corrolation with each other. For this particular
              study, this Classsifer Model will not predict the "better" platform- rather it fill find the most important in achieving an above average score.

          <div class="info-box">
            <p>One of the first steps taken for this form of analysis was to convert the information in the Average Userscore of the data into 
            a column that displayed if the score was above or below a certain number. The number selected was seven as this appeared to be the average number 
          for most of the platforms. If a video game had an Averge Userscore of greater than seven it was assigned a "1". If it did not then it was scored with a "0".
        <br>
        <br>
        One hot encoding was then applied to the "Platforms" column to the data. What this means is that the same concept was the above was applied but to the different types of 
        platforms that are of interest to this project. This information forms the independent variable. The review score is the dependent variable. Note that the WiiU column was 
        removed before it entered the Random Forest Classifer as the console has not been in production for almost four years and is not as popular anymore.
        <br>
        <br>
        After this was done, using Scikit Learn's Random Forest Classifier model, the information was used to be applied into a Random Forest. 
        The algorithm yeilded an accuracy of almost 75% for the model. For the purpose of this study, this a good level of accuracy.

          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>The above table displays the result of the Random Forest Classifer when the random sample size is equal to 100. The values are proportion 
            of importance of each platform when placed in a Random Forest Classfier. It appears that the PC platform is the most importance when achieving an
            average userscore greater than 7 during the eighth generation of gaming consoles. This is then followed with the Xbox One.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Whilst an answer has been reached with PC being the most influential is recieving a rating greater than 7 in a random sample of 100, considerations can still be made. 
            The most important of which being that, in the original dataframe, there are much more games with a platform listed as "PC" than any other platform. Review
            scores are also tricky subject to analyse due to bias and they tend to be subjecive to each individual user.

        <hr>
        <p>The Metascore is the same for every platform except for WiiU which is, on average, scored higher by one point. A similar trend can be seen 
          with the Average Userscore on the Metacritic site. Play Station Vita and WiiU were rated as 8 were as the other platforms were rated with a 7. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Because the results are very similar for each other, we must look at other ways to analyse whether the platform a game is released on influences its average ratings.
